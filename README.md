# wishlist

Wishlist is a directory for SSH Apps, and a SSH app itself.

It can be used to start multiple SSH apps within a single package, and provide a list of them over SSH as well.
You can also list apps provided elsewhere.

You can also use the `wishlist` CLI to just start a listing of external SSH apps based on a JSON config file.
